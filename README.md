*How this application works?*

1) A user types a word in the input field, selects a language and clicks the GREET button. The output is printed in the Your Greeting box.
2) The application prints an error in the Your Greeting box when the user greets the same person more than once, forgets to select a language, or enters a name that contains a digit.
3) The You've Greeted: box shows the names of people that you've greeted.
